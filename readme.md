# Lodging Maintenance Feedback Classifier andAnalyzer using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
## Introduction
### Problem
After a customer visits a lodging/hotel, they can leave a rating andalso write a review about the hotel based on their experience. Customersare free to leave both a positive or negative feedback. Some reviews havemixed reactions. Users leave many reviews and they contain issues that
needs to be addressed by the hotel management. Based on a user review, if the hotel management can listen to the guest and make sure all the
issues are fixed and addressed, the guests are going to be very happythenext time they visit. This shows that the hotel management cares about
the customers. But the problem is that most hotels have an issue of prioritizingandclassifying these reviews and complaints. As a result, they fall behindonproviding necessary solutions. This in return leads themto lose customersand build a bad reputation, which will hurt their business in the longterm. If by any chance, there is some issue in the hotel; the management shouldbe aware of it and take some action to solve it. Moreover,most hotels can‚Äôt allocate a dedicated person to checkonall reviews as this is a tedious process as some hotels have a lot of
customers coming in daily, which in return will result in many reviews. Therefore there is a big need for an automated systemwhere a reviewcanbe understood and maintenance issues could be highlighted to the hotel
management.
### Solution
We try to create an <b>NLP</b> system that can help the hotel management to understand the reviews and help them to solve the issues. The system will be able to:
* Identify the issues in the reviews
* Provide the solutions to the issues
* Provide the feedback to the guests
